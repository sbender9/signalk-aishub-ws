# signalk-aishub-ws
SignalK node server plugin to convert data from AisHub's web api to signalk vessels

Install with

`npm install signalk-aishub-ws`

You must get an API key from AisHub.net to use this and they require that you send them some data. I use [marinetrafficreporter](https://github.com/tkurki/marinetrafficreporter) for that.
